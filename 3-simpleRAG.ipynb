    "This notebook demonstrates **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** - a powerful technique that enables AI models to access and reason about external documents and knowledge bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is RAG?**\n",
    "RAG transforms static AI models into dynamic assistants that can:\n",
    "- **Remember** every document you share with them\n",
    "- **Search** through vast libraries of content in milliseconds  \n",
    "- **Reason** about information from multiple sources simultaneously\n",
    "- **Update** their knowledge without retraining the entire model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why RAG Matters:**\n",
    "Instead of relying only on training data, RAG-enhanced models can reference your specific documents, course materials, and knowledge bases to provide accurate, cited responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already built a vector database - now let's add the intelligent layer that makes RAG truly powerful! 🚀"

    "## 🏗️ The LlamaStack RAG Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "LlamaStack organizes RAG capabilities into **three elegant layers** that work together to create intelligent, knowledge-aware applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. 🗄️ Storage Layer (The Foundation)\n",
    "This is where your knowledge lives:\n",
    "- **Vector IO**: Stores document embeddings for semantic search - converts text into mathematical vectors that capture meaning\n",
    "- **KeyValue IO**: Manages structured metadata and simple lookups (document titles, authors, dates)\n",
    "- **Relational IO**: Handles complex queries across structured data (coming soon)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 🔧 RAG Layer (The Intelligence)\n",
    "This is where documents become searchable knowledge:\n",
    "- **Document Ingestion**: Automatically downloads and processes files, URLs, and content\n",
    "- **Intelligent Chunking**: Splits large documents into optimal pieces (typically 512 tokens) for retrieval\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant content based on meaning, not just keyword matching\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. 🤖 User Layer (The Interface)  \n",
    "This is where users interact with the knowledge:\n",
    "- **Context-Aware Agents**: LLMs that can automatically use RAG tools to answer questions\n",
    "- **Multi-Document Reasoning**: Agents that synthesize information from multiple sources\n",
    "- **Conversational Memory**: Maintains context across interactions while accessing external knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Magic:** When you ask a question, the system searches the vector database for relevant chunks, then provides those chunks as context to the LLM for generating informed, cited responses.\n",
