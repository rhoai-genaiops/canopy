    "# 🐣 Document Intelligence with Docling: Unlocking Complex Academic Content\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Document Intelligence** - the advanced capability to understand and process complex documents like research papers, academic materials, and structured content that traditional RAG systems struggle with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:**\n",
    "Imagine trying to build an educational AI assistant using only basic text extraction from research papers. You'd lose:\n",
    "- **📊 Table data** with crucial research findings\n",
    "- **🧮 Mathematical formulas** and scientific notation  \n",

    "- **📝 Multi-column layouts** common in academic papers\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution: Docling**\n",
    "Docling is an advanced document processing toolkit that acts like a brilliant research assistant, understanding the **meaning and structure** of complex academic documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Build:**\n",
    "- **🔬 Intelligent Document Processor**: Extract rich content from complex PDFs\n",
    "- **📚 Enhanced RAG System**: Query tables, formulas, and structured content  \n",
    "- **🎯 Academic AI Assistant**: Answer questions using complete document understanding\n",
